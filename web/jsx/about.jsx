				<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
				<p>Our mission is to inform fellow alcoholics of products to facilitate their bad habits while simultaneously giving the big Fuck You to event holders who price gouge the consumer on the purchase of alcoholic beverages. We've already paid through the nose for an event whose only purpose is to distract us from how shitty our lives are, why do you bend us over for a snap of liquor?</p>
				<p>No one likes paying $14 for a shitty light beer after paying $30 for parking and $100 per ticket at a sporting event. Secretchugs aims to empower the drinker to proclaim "No more!" to unreasonable prices. Together we can stop the raping, one chug at a time.</p>
